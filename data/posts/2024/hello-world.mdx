Yay! First post means the blog finally works!

I have big ambitions for this space, but I think truthfully I was letting them get in the way of making progress.

For now, I'll mostly be posting about photography.

Anyway, here's a few of my all time favorite photos as an excuse to play with how photo posts are presented on this site.

<PostImageGroup>
  <PostImage alt="Behold, a photograph" props={props} index={0} />
  <PostImage alt="Behold, a photograph" props={props} index={1} />
  <PostImage alt="Behold, a photograph" props={props} index={2} />
  <PostImage alt="Behold, a photograph" props={props} index={3} />
</PostImageGroup>

That's all for now. Feel free to email me if you like or or hate it (see Links in the navbar for my address).
