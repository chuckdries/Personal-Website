  # Ektachrome (blurry)
---

As a few of you know, for the last few years my mom has gotten me a photo book of my work as a Christmas gift.
The first year it was a total surprise she arranged it all herself, but in subsequent years she lets me curate
and arrange it. I really love the excercise of putting it together. It's a great chance to reflect on my time and my work.
I was showing this year's book to my cousin in law and he suggested I put it online, which I think is a great idea
and the perfect opportunity to tinker with the blog.

So here we are: here are all the photos I included in the book, in the order they appear. The book itself is sparse on
captions but since this is a blog I'll be writing a little more

## Arizona trip 2023

Since the book is a Christmas gift, we prepare it in November, so any photos I take in December make it into the next year's.
Last year I spent 3 weeks in Arizona in December, starting in Tucson

### Tucson

Tucson is such a beautiful place - something about the desert out there is just special.
I don't know if these photos really do it justice.

### The Superstitions

I woke up on Christmas eve and discovered it was foggy?! in Phoenix?! so I
hopped in the car and drove to Lost Dutchman State Park, which ended up being
a fantastic decision. The fog had cleared but the clouds were still delightful.

### Boyce Thompson Arboretum

This is one of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Arizona.
I cannot recommend it enough. I usually take way more pictures when
I go there, but this year I mostly shot a roll of Lomo Purple (I'm
glad to have tried it but it turns out I'm not a fan).

### Biosphere 2

What a cool and unique looking place! Unfortunately while I was there
my shutter started to malfunction and most of the photos I took didn't
end up being taken at all. That said, the ones that did turn out are
some of my favorites! I'm especially fond of the stairs picture.

## Macro roses

I love hanging out in the International Rose Test Garden in Portland. The 
vibes are just so pleasant. I took all these roses pictures with my Hasselblad 500C and a macro tube.

### Instax

The first time I brought the macro tube to the rose garden I shot exclusively
on Instax. I wasn't confident with it yet (and indeed many of these are underexposed),
but I do have a few bangers here. I ended up mailing most of these originals to my friends.

### Ektachrome

I was pondering the Instax's, thinking I liked the contrast and drama but wish they had more detail.
Well, Ektachrome has contrast! These are a real treat to look at in real life. Unfortunately
it was an overcast day and that 100 ISO was a little too slow, many of these have motion blur. Only the
first 4 made it into the book, the rest I deemed too blurry for the book, but I figured why not include them here!

## Olympic National Park

I to Olympic here with my sister in March, which ended up being a delightful time
to visit.
