As a few of you know, for the last few years my mom has gotten me a photo book of my work as a Christmas gift.

![The 2024 book](./IMG_5240.jpg)

The first book was in 2022 - she downloaded a bunch of pictures from my website,
arranged them into a book, and surprised me with it. It was the most thoughtful 
and impressive gift I've ever received.

Last year and this year though, she allows me to curate and arrange it. 
I really love the excercise of putting it together. It's a great chance to reflect on my time and my work.
I was showing this year's book to my cousin and he suggested I put it online, which I think is a great idea
and the perfect opportunity to tinker with the blog.

So this is that: all the photos I included in the book and then some.
The book itself is sparse on captions but since this is a blog I'll be writing a little more.

## Arizona trip 2023

Since the book is a Christmas gift, we prepare it in November and any photos I
take in December make it into the next year's book.
Last year I spent 3 weeks in Arizona in December, starting in Tucson

### Tucson

Tucson is such a beautiful place - something about the desert out there is just special.
I don't know if these photos really do it justice.

### The Superstitions

I woke up on Christmas eve and discovered it was foggy?! in Phoenix?! so I
hopped in the car and drove to Lost Dutchman State Park, which ended up being
a fantastic decision. The fog had cleared but the clouds were still delightful.

These are all digital. I took a large format B&W shot that day but the timing
and composition was worse than any of these.

### Boyce Thompson Arboretum

This is one of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Arizona.
I cannot recommend it enough. I usually get a lot of photos I love when
I go there, but this year I mostly shot a roll of Lomo Purple, which I'm
glad to have tried it but it turns out I'm not a fan.

### Biosphere 2

What a cool and unique looking place! Unfortunately while I was there
my shutter started to malfunction and most of the photos I took didn't
end up being taken at all. That said, the ones that did turn out are
some of my favorites. I'm especially fond of the stairs.

## Olympic National Park

I went to Olympic NP with my sister in March, which ended up being
a delightful time to visit.

### The Hoh Rainforest

We hiked the Hall of Mosses. I wasn't expecting it to be snowy but I am so
glad it was. Moss + snow is such a good look. Also on this hike my sister
introduced me to fingerless gloves for making it easier to operate a camera
in the cold.

### Lake Crescent

Earlier that day we had gone to Rialto Beach to try and catch the sunset only
for it to be cloudy. I was feeling kinda disappointed about that, but my mood 
totally turned around we ended up passing by Lake Crescent at peak blue hour. 
We wouldn't have been the right place at the right time if we hadn't gone to Rialto
first, so I'm glad that happened. It was incredibly surreal. When I took the
first picture in this row I thought it was going to be the best of the whole trip,
but we ended up going back the next day and it was even more beautiful.

### Hurricane Ridge

Beautiful view, terrifying drive. Chains are required for a reason!

## Macro roses

I love hanging out in the International Rose Test Garden in Portland. The 
vibes are just so pleasant. I took all the square rose pictures with my 
Hasselblad 500C and a macro tube.

### Instax

The first time I brought the macro tube to the rose garden I shot exclusively
on Instax. Both the macro tube and the Nons instax back were new to me, and I
wasn't feeling confident with them (and indeed many of these are underexposed),
but I do have a few bangers here. I ended up taking like 40 pictures over multiple
visits. There's something very special about a life size flower reproduced 
completely analog on site. I mailed most of the originals to my friends.

### Ektachrome

I was pondering the Instax's, thinking I liked the contrast and drama but wished they had more detail.
I was hesitant to reach for Ektachrome - I had had a relatively bad experience the first time I used it, but I wanted
contrast, so I gave it a shot and it ultimately delivered in a huge way. These are a real treat to look at in real life.
Unfortunately these were taken on an overcast day and 100 ISO was a little too slow, so many of them 
have motion blur. Only the first 4 in this row made it into the book, the rest of the roll was too blurry for print.
That said, bytes are cheap so I've included 3 of the rejects here as a lil treat

I also like these a lot. The first photo in this row is on the cover of the book.

### Ektachrome on 4x5

Finally, I made it back to the rose garden with my Super Graphic and a 210mm lens (CQ TODO lens name).
