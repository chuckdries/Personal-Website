As a few of you know, for the last few years my mom has gotten me a photo book of my work as a Christmas gift.
The first year it was a total surprise she arranged it all herself, but in subsequent years she lets me curate
and arrange it. 

I really love the excercise of putting it together. It's a great chance to reflect on my time and my work.
I was showing this year's book to my cousin in law and he suggested I put it online, which I think is a great idea
and the perfect opportunity to tinker with the blog.

So here we are: here are all the photos I included in the book and then some.
The book itself is sparse on captions but since this is a blog I'll be writing a little more.

## Arizona trip 2023

Since the book is a Christmas gift, we prepare it in November and any photos I take in December make it into the next year's.
Last year I spent 3 weeks in Arizona in December, starting in Tucson

### Tucson

Tucson is such a beautiful place - something about the desert out there is just special.
I don't know if these photos really do it justice.

### The Superstitions

I woke up on Christmas eve and discovered it was foggy?! in Phoenix?! so I
hopped in the car and drove to Lost Dutchman State Park, which ended up being
a fantastic decision. The fog had cleared but the clouds were still delightful.

These are all digital. I took a large format B&W shot that day but the timing
and composition was worse than any of these.

### Boyce Thompson Arboretum

This is one of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Arizona.
I cannot recommend it enough. I usually take way more pictures when
I go there, but this year I mostly shot a roll of Lomo Purple (I'm
glad to have tried it but it turns out I'm not a fan).

### Biosphere 2

What a cool and unique looking place! Unfortunately while I was there
my shutter started to malfunction and most of the photos I took didn't
end up being taken at all. That said, the ones that did turn out are
some of my favorites. I'm especially fond of the stairs.

## Macro roses

I love hanging out in the International Rose Test Garden in Portland. The 
vibes are just so pleasant. I took all the square rose pictures with my 
Hasselblad 500C and a macro tube.

### Instax

The first time I brought the macro tube to the rose garden I shot exclusively
on Instax. I wasn't confident with it yet (and indeed many of these are underexposed),
but I do have a few bangers here. I ended up mailing most of these originals to my friends.

### Ektachrome

I was pondering the Instax's, thinking I liked the contrast and drama but wished they had more detail.
I had had a relatively bad experience the first time I shot Ektachrome, so I was hesitant, but I wanted
contrast and it definitely delivered. These are a real treat to look at in real life.
Unfortunately these were taken on an overcast day and that 100 ISO was a little too slow, so many of these 
have motion blur. Only the first 4 made it into the book, the latter 3 I deemed too blurry,
but I figured why not include them here!

I also like these a lot.

### Ektachrome on 4x5

Finally, I made it back to the rose garden with my Super Graphic and a 210mm lens (CQ TODO lens name).

## Olympic National Park

I went to the Olympic NP with my sister in March, which ended up being
a delightful time to visit.
