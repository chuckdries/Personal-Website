When I lived in the Phoenix area, I struggled to see its beauty. Or perhaps I didn't go looking for it. For example,
I had no idea that if you turn left on Central and follow it all the way south
you can drive to the top of South Mountain, where there are a bunch of good
spots to watch the sunset.

A sunset view I can drive to is the _perfect_ situation to bust out large format.
I brought my Intrepid 4x5 with me. These two shots are Ektachrome, I'm especially 
happy with the first one.

I just got a new light meter, and I'm not super experienced metering
the sky to begin with, so I had a lot of apprehension that these wouldn't turn out, but
they totally did!

This next one is Portra 400. I'm also very happy with it.

I also had a partial roll of Portra 160 loaded in the Minolta, which I'm pretty pleased with overall.
