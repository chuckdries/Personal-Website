Last Tuesday it was supposed to rain all day. I debated working from home,
but I ended up going into the office anyway. I don't always carry a camera around,
but knowing it's spring, I brought my Hasselblad just in case.

And I'm glad I did! The rain broke and the clouds parted during the workday, so I wandered down 
to the waterfront park where the cherry blossoms were finally blooming.

The atmosphere was magical. I ran into an old friend! I chatted with a few
people who asked about my camera, even made a few new instagram mutuals.

I love this city. It's a place with so much beauty, and so much joy.

You know, I don't think I would've ever even tried film photography if I hadn't moved
here. Nowadays film is like My Thing so I think a lot of people assume I started
with it, but my first camera was digital, and I shot exclusively digital for
like a decade. It was only after I moved here that I visited Blue Moon
and fell in love with large format.

These aren't the first large format photos I ever took, but they're the first
ones that kinda turned out. It was a warm,
beautiful day. I was hanging out with a friend after work, right outside
my office on the waterfront. 

The ghost bridge in the sky is because I had a pinhole in
my lens board, which acted like a second lens. This artifact is actually
what allowed me to diagnose the issue.

On the same day I took those bridge photos, I also took this photo in the office.

The office... it feels strange to admit that I've grown attached to a place of work
(and perhaps the lesson here is not to) but now that it's
[going away](https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2025/03/adobe-will-close-downtown-portland-office.html),
it's becoming clear how much it matters to me. 

Honestly, though, it's hard to say how much. I struggle to disentangle my feelings about
the place from my feelings about the situation. These things do not exist in a vacuum. 

Allow me to tell you a few things that I love about it.

I love the tall trees that surround it. In the fall, they light up the space in a magnificent way.

I love the view of Mount Hood we get through the big east facing windows.
In the winter we get some truly breathtaking sunrises (that always seem to evade photographing).

I love that sometimes the lobby gets amazing light in the afternoon

I love the people that it brought together. My team here is the best I've ever
worked with, and I'm sad to see this happen to us.

I don't want to leave this city. I hate feeling like I'm being forced to experience
change, even though I recognize that that's often the nature of change.
