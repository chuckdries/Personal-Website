An incandescent issue tracker

<!-- more -->

As an intern at Axosoft, I worked on several major features of Glo, a trello-like issue board with features geared towards developers and git integration

Glo is built on ReactJS. The backend is a series of microservices connected with Kafka. I worked on both front and back end, but the most visible changes I made were to the front end.

### Attachment Viewer

The first large React component I wrote myself was the Attachment Viewer. I'm really proud of it aesthetically. It's still my favorite part of the app.
