My first real website

<!-- more -->

![The 2015 site](screenshot.png)

I was on my high school's robotics team, and we needed a website. This is where I really learned CSS in depth, I handled the photography and wrote the entire site by hand fresh every year. Back in 2015, single page websites were still new and exciting, and part of me is still super proud of how that year's verion turned out.  

I no longer control the content of the site, so instead of linking it directly, I'm linking it as it existed in two different school years while I was still in charge.
