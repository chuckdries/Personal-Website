  <h3>A brief history of Chuck &amp; tech</h3>
  <p>I'm a computer science student with experience in photography, digital and print graphic design, teaching, and leading.
    I've been "into computers" my whole life, but I didn't really get into the technical stuff until middle school, where
    I had to learn about networking and bash to run a minecraft server. Today, I do most of my work in JavaScript and I experiment
    with VR and game design in my free time. In a different life, I might have been a poet or a baker, but as it is I do
    these things on the side.
