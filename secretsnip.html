<!-- We'll have tech, design, photography, and leadership sections, each a bit different-->
<!-- perhaps these can all go under like an overview section, then I can have me, experience, projects, awards, instead of splitting projects between design and tech, for example -->
<!-- that being said, I like the idea of a photography section, but also a projects section structured like a product features page would look nice-->
<!-- maybe I have a projects section in tech and design, in tech I list like resume and in design I list like product features page -->
<!-- maybe my sections are tech, design, photography, leadership, projects, experience, where I just link to projects or experience-->
<!-- or maybe I have experience and split it up into tech experience and design experience incl. projects -->
<!-- I think I like my original plan. There can be duplication between tech and design projects as they'll be presented differently. Design projects will look like a product page.-->
<!-- tech will have overview, skills, work experience, project experience, academics-->
<!-- design will have samples from previous projects, frontends, I'm the rare good at design and tech but my designs are still lightweight and many tech people ignore design -->
<!-- photography will have sample portraits and SP work -->
<!-- leadership will have maybe some text? -->
